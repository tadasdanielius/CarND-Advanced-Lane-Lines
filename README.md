### The Goal of this Project

The goal of this project is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. 

### Steps if this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Use color transforms, gradients, to create a thresholded binary image.
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle
position.
